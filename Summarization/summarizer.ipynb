    "## SUMMARIZATION LANGCHAIN : \n",
    "Summarization is a key component of many tasks involving large language models (LLMs). It enables the distillation of extensive text into a concise and meaningful set of points. Whether dealing with a brief document or an entire book, choosing the right summarization approach depends on the text's length and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are five approaches to summarization, ranging from beginner-friendly methods to more advanced techniques. While these aren't exhaustive, they offer a strong starting point. If you come across a unique approach that works well, consider sharing it with the broader community!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentways of Summarization in Langchain\n",
    "1. #### Summarizing a Few Sentences – Basic Prompts :\n",
    "    - Use straightforward prompts to condense short passages into clear summaries. This is ideal for quick insights or simple tasks.\n",
    "2. #### Summarizing a Few Paragraphs – Prompt Templates :\n",
    "    - Employ structured prompt templates that guide the LLM to extract key points from multiple paragraphs. This approach is great for slightly larger texts that require thematic organization.\n",
    "3. #### Summarizing a Few Pages – Map-Reduce :\n",
    "    - Break the text into chunks and summarize each individually (the \"map\" step), then combine those summaries into a cohesive output (the \"reduce\" step). This method excels when summarizing medium-length documents like reports or articles.\n",
    "4. #### Refine chain summarizer :\n",
    "    - A chain for refining summaries by processing each document in stages.\n",
    "    - Similar to map reduce with one key difference : with every chunk, it passes the summary of previous chunk as well to the llm\n",
    "5. #### Summarizing Text of Unknown Length – Agents :   TBD\n",
    "    - Leverage intelligent agents that dynamically adjust their approach based on the input's length and complexity. Agents can handle diverse text sizes, making them the most versatile option for summarization."

So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\n",

However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\n",

When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\n",

    "There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\n",

       "[Document(metadata={}, page_content=' Cisco Conﬁden+al Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen. It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to be in your midst in the historic capital city of Sofia. Bulgaria is an ancient land, with a long history and a glorious cultural heritage. We know of its literary, philosophical and cultural tradition. The statue of Sofia, in the Centre of this beautiful city, holding the symbols of fame and wisdom in her hands and wearing the crown of the Goddess of fate truly characterizes the aspirations of all mankind. India and Bulgaria have a long-standing friendship. Both have ancient civilizations and our histories have involved contacts with numerous other societies. We have been able to benefit from this by assimilating in our cultures various facets of other civilizations. This has enabled the development of India\\'s and Bulgaria\\'s multi-culturalism drawn from different religious, ethnic and linguistic groups. This is an abiding gift from our previous generations, which we in turn are preserving for the future. India and Bulgaria have always had wide-ranging contacts between our Governments and our people. Our co-operation is multi-dimensional and extends to the realms of politics, trade and economics, science and technology and culture. This relationship is based on continuity and mutual understanding. The exchange of Presidential Visits in 1994 to Sofia and in 1998 to New Delhi has provided the momentum to strengthen and broad base our contacts. My own visit here is in continuation of these high-level exchanges and we hope that it will serve to further enhance our bilateral co-operation. Time has come both Bulgaria and India should identify the core competence in specific areas and select projects of importance for joint design, development, production and marketing in a time-bound manner. I am glad that both countries have identified a number of scientific research projects under the Indo-Bulgarian Science & Technology cooperation. Excellency, I am confident that Indo-Bulgarian Partnership has a bright future. In the new millennium, the entire world is moving in the direction of free and democratic systems. India and Bulgaria share these values. In our own experience of the last fifty years and more, we have found the democratic par liamentary system an appropriate vehicle for serving the needs and aspirations of our people. As with the polity, the current century is seeing a general consensus on the need to undertake structural economic reforms to open up possibilities for enhancement of the welfare of the people of this planet. In India, we are proceeding with the second generation of our economic reforms and are happy to see the success that we have been able to obtain. India is increasingly recognized as a global economic power with notable successes in the frontier areas of information technology, science, space technology and in newly emerging technologies such as nano and bio technology. We have seen that Bulgaria has undertaken major steps in the process of liberalization and has rapidly moved towards a free market economy. I am sure that this will open up opportunities for further extending our economic and commercial ties. The high value attached to education in both our countries and the strong human capital base that we have been able to build up will definitely strengthen mutually beneficial co-operation. Our two way business is presently very  Cisco Conﬁden+al limited. We should enhance our trade and business to billion dollars in a few years time. In India, we believe that the fruits of economic progress should be widely available, especially to the under-privileged sections of our population. The world still has a lot to do for eradication of poverty, unemployment and disease; this shared responsibility must be borne by the global community as a whole. In the realm of international affairs, we too need to address the question of attainment of an equitable world order. We are happy to see that the international community is, indeed, making efforts for such a just system based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. The United Nations should function as a true international body and empowered by all members to lead to cohesive conclusions and actions. At the same time, Excellency, as you are aware, new challenges and threats have emerged. The most serious issue we are currently confronted with is that of international terrorism. Terrorism has become a major force jeopardizing international peace and security. It would seem that no State or people are free from this danger.

The great Bulgarian revolutionary Georgi Rakovski has written that \"The oldest civilization in the world was that of India and different beliefs and customs originated from it\". The works of Gandhi, Tagore and Nehru have been translated into Bulgarian and have been popular here. Bulgarian poets Hristo Botev and Hristo Smirenski have exercised influence on Indian writers. During the 19th century, Bulgarian literature reflected the national consciousness and patriotic sentiments as did the writings in India during our freedom struggle. The contacts in the cultural sphere continue and I know that many Bulgarians travel to India to study literature, dance, music and philosophy. I was very happy to note that the Sofia University has a separate Indology Department which offers courses in the languages, history and philosophy of India. The interest amongst Bulgarians in Indian classical music, yoga and ancient Indian scriptures are only some of the aspects of Indian society that have been absorbed in this country. I am also glad to learn that Bulgarian Sportsmen and coaches have been training Indian sportspersons who get the benefit of the experience of your great sporting nation. From our side we could suggest some new areas of cooperation in which India has gained experience. These could include pharmaceuticals, food processing, power and also a sharing of our experience of privatisation. I am optimistic that flourishing economic and scientific ties will take more and more Indians and Bulgarians to each other\\'s country and forge our bonds of friendship further. Excellency, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my personal greetings and that of my delegation for the warm and friendly hospitality that has been accorded by you.

It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to be in your midst in the historic capital city of Sofia. Bulgaria is an ancient land, with a long history and a glorious cultural heritage. We know of its literary, philosophical and cultural tradition. The statue of Sofia, in the Centre of this beautiful city, holding the symbols of fame and wisdom in her hands and wearing the crown of the Goddess of fate truly characterizes the aspirations of all mankind. India and Bulgaria have a long-standing friendship. Both have ancient civilizations and our histories have involved contacts with numerous other societies. We have been able to benefit from this by assimilating in our cultures various facets of other civilizations. This has enabled the development of India\\'s and Bulgaria\\'s multi-culturalism drawn from different religious, ethnic and linguistic groups. This is an abiding gift from our previous generations, which we in turn are preserving for the future. India and Bulgaria have always had wide-ranging contacts between our Governments and our people. Our co-operation is multi-dimensional and extends to the realms of politics, trade and economics, science and technology and culture. This relationship is based on continuity and mutual understanding. The exchange of Presidential Visits in 1994 to Sofia and in 1998 to New Delhi has provided the momentum to strengthen and broad base our contacts. My own visit here is in continuation of these high-level exchanges and we hope that it will serve to further enhance our bilateral co-operation. Time has come both Bulgaria and India should identify the core competence in specific areas and select projects of importance for joint design, development, production and marketing in a time-bound manner. I am glad that both countries have identified a number of scientific research projects under the Indo-Bulgarian Science & Technology cooperation. Excellency, I am confident that Indo-Bulgarian Partnership has a bright future. In the new millennium, the entire world is moving in the direction of free and democratic systems. India and Bulgaria share these values. In our own experience of the last fifty years and more, we have found the democratic par liamentary system an appropriate vehicle for serving the needs and aspirations of our people. As with the polity, the current century is seeing a general consensus on the need to undertake structural economic reforms to open up possibilities for enhancement of the welfare of the people of this planet. In India, we are proceeding with the second generation of our economic reforms and are happy to see the success that we have been able to obtain. India is increasingly recognized as a global economic power with notable successes in the frontier areas of information technology, science, space technology and in newly emerging technologies such as nano and bio technology. We have seen that Bulgaria has undertaken major steps in the process of liberalization and has rapidly moved towards a free market economy. I am sure that this will open up opportunities for further extending our economic and commercial ties. The high value attached to education in both our countries and the strong human capital base that we have been able to build up will definitely strengthen mutually beneficial co-operation. Our two way business is presently very  Cisco Conﬁden+al limited. We should enhance our trade and business to billion dollars in a few years time. In India, we believe that the fruits of economic progress should be widely available, especially to the under-privileged sections of our population. The world still has a lot to do for eradication of poverty, unemployment and disease; this shared responsibility must be borne by the global community as a whole. In the realm of international affairs, we too need to address the question of attainment of an equitable world order.

The great Bulgarian revolutionary Georgi Rakovski has written that \"The oldest civilization in the world was that of India and different beliefs and customs originated from it\". The works of Gandhi, Tagore and Nehru have been translated into Bulgarian and have been popular here. Bulgarian poets Hristo Botev and Hristo Smirenski have exercised influence on Indian writers. During the 19th century, Bulgarian literature reflected the national consciousness and patriotic sentiments as did the writings in India during our freedom struggle. The contacts in the cultural sphere continue and I know that many Bulgarians travel to India to study literature, dance, music and philosophy. I was very happy to note that the Sofia University has a separate Indology Department which offers courses in the languages, history and philosophy of India. The interest amongst Bulgarians in Indian classical music, yoga and ancient Indian scriptures are only some of the aspects of Indian society that have been absorbed in this country. I am also glad to learn that Bulgarian Sportsmen and coaches have been training Indian sportspersons who get the benefit of the experience of your great sporting nation. From our side we could suggest some new areas of cooperation in which India has gained experience. These could include pharmaceuticals, food processing, power and also a sharing of our experience of privatisation. I am optimistic that flourishing economic and scientific ties will take more and more Indians and Bulgarians to each other's country and forge our bonds of friendship further. Excellency, I would like to take this opportunity to convey my personal greetings and that of my delegation for the warm and friendly hospitality that has been accorded by you. This is in keeping with the time-honoured tradition of Bulgaria and its great people. It is also a reflection of the regard with which India is held in this beautiful country.  Cisco Conﬁden+al\n",
